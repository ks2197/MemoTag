# ðŸ§  MemoTag Cognitive Risk Detection â€“ AI/ML Proof of Concept

This repository contains a proof-of-concept pipeline designed to detect early signs of cognitive decline using simulated voice samples and NLP feature analysis.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To build a lightweight and interpretable system that processes raw speech-like transcripts and flags potential cognitive impairment using a combination of:

- Linguistic features (e.g., hesitations, word count, speech rate)
- Simulated audio cues (e.g., pause count, pitch variability)
- Rule-based risk scoring
